Website: [LiKe Commerce](https://kelwynoliveira.github.io/like-commerce/)

A simple e-commerce website built to solve a real-world problem: selling personal items during a relocation.

📚 **Background**  
"LiKe" is a blend of *[Lí]dia* (my wife) and *[Ke]lwyn* (me).  
We developed this website while preparing to move from the northern to the southern region of Brazil, as a practical solution for selling the items we couldn’t take with us.

After two weeks listing our items on common ad platforms like OLX and Facebook Marketplace, we had received only a few messages and closed no deals. So I decided to build a custom website to improve our chances.

💡 **Why this matters**  
This project highlights my problem-solving mindset:  
Instead of waiting for solutions, I created one. Even small projects like this reflect the way I approach challenges — combining design, coding, and clear objectives.
